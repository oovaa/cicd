# CICD done

Hi all I've successfully made my first CICD pipeline
provided from Coursera [link]. It gave me skills needed to automate the process form coding on my local machine taking this code and make it live in my VPS and everything is automated (lazy me)

So yeah in the course they used AWS and I'm using Digital ocean so that made me suffer a bit but I was able to manage it (as usual)

I've learned what is the DOCR (container registry is like Docker hub but it is my own)

Then used GitHub actions to update the Docker image there based on my latest changes

And configured GitHub actions with ssh to log into my VPS and run the needed commands to update and redeploy the service

finally
